# Kaholo Helm Plugin
This plugin extends Kaholo's functionality by providing access to [Helm](https://helm.sh/). Helm helps you manage Kubernetes applications â€” Helm Charts help you define, install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes application. 

## Prerequisites
To use Helm, you will require a [Kuberenetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster. A Kubernetes cluster is a physical or virtual machine running a Kubernetes Control Plane and at least one Kubernetes Node. Within Kubernetes Nodes, one can run pods, which are containers not unlike [Docker containers](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/). Running containerized applications has become wildly popular because it provides a highly standard, secure, scalable, and lightweight architecture with features such as auto-scaling and rolling upgrades.

There are several Kaholo plugins that create Kubernetes clusters, including ones for cloud platforms [Google GKE](https://github.com/Kaholo/kaholo-plugin-google-cloud-kubernetes-engine), [Amazon EKS](https://github.com/Kaholo/kaholo-plugin-aws-eks), and [Azure](https://github.com/Kaholo/kaholo-plugin-azure-cli). Alternatively you may run your own kubernetes using microk8s or minikube, among others.

Helm then organizes continerized Kubernetes applications into packages called [Helm Charts](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/). Charts can be customized for your specific needs but are also made widely available in public repositories such as [ArtifactHub](https://artifacthub.io/). This allows anyone with a Kubernetes cluster to deploy countless software applications quickly and effortlessly.

To use the Helm plugin for Kaholo, you will need a service account with sufficient access to your Kubernetes cluster. A newly create cluster often provides a default administrative account. These accounts are generally not suitable for automating the installation Helm charts. For example they may require web-based logins and use OAuth tokens that expire within an hour. However, these accounts are useful for creating appropriate service accounts for automation - for use in Kaholo and with Helm.

## Access and Authentication
There are many ways to get appropriate access and authentiction to a Kubernetes cluster, and the exact method will vary greatly from provider to provider. The kubernetes CLI (`kubectl`) is a common tool that works well with ALL implementations of kubernetes.

Here is an example using Google's CLI (`glcoud`) to gain access too an existing GKE Kubernetes cluster and then `kubectl` to create a service account named `kaholo` in namespace `dev-test`. This type of service account is ideal for use in automation.

    # gain access to the cluster in GKE
    ken@cm0108au-bravo:~$ gcloud container clusters get-credentials mynewcluster --zone=europe-central2-b
    Fetching cluster endpoint and auth data.
    kubeconfig entry generated for mynewcluster.

    # get the cluster's CA certificate and server endpoint
    ken@cm0108au-bravo:~$ kubectl config view --raw
    apiVersion: v1
    clusters:
    - cluster:
        certificate-authority-data: LS0tLS1CRUd...very long string...FLS0tLS0K
        server: https://34.116.131.193
    name: gke_plugins-helm-alpha_europe-central2-b_mynewcluster

    # create a Kubernetes namespace
    ken@cm0108au-bravo:~$ kubectl create namespace dev-test
    namespace/dev-test created

    # create a service account
    ken@cm0108au-bravo:~$ kubectl create serviceaccount kaholo --namespace dev-test
    serviceaccount/kaholo created

    # grant the service account cluster-admin privileges
    ken@cm0108au-bravo:~$ kubectl create rolebinding dev-test-admin --clusterrole=cluster-admin --serviceaccount=dev-test:kaholo --namespace=dev-test
    rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/dev-test-admin created

    # get the name of the token for the service account
    ken@cm0108au-bravo:~$ kubectl describe serviceaccount kaholo --namespace dev-test
    Name:                kaholo
    Namespace:           dev-test
    Tokens:              kaholo-token-wlhpr

    ken@cm0108au-bravo:~$ kubectl describe secret kaholo-token-wlhpr --namespace dev-test
    Name:         kaholo-token-wlhpr
    Namespace:    dev-test
    Annotations:  kubernetes.io/service-account.name: kaholo
                kubernetes.io/service-account.uid: e57f89c4-74b3-4f48-870e-71236d6d8e8e

    Type:  kubernetes.io/service-account-token

    Data
    ====
    token:      eyJhbGciOiJ...very long string...JK3RGEpfDA
    ca.crt:     1509 bytes
    namespace:  8 bytes

In this example we now have all we need to use Helm in Kaholo:
* Cluster CA Certificate: `LS0tLS1CRUd...very long string...FLS0tLS0K`
* API Server Endpoint: `https://34.116.131.193`
* Service Account Token: `eyJhbGciOiJ...very long string...JK3RGEpfDA`
* Namespace: `dev-test`

Note: Some implementations of Kubernetes will provide the CA certificate in standard multiline PEM format that starts with `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----`. The Helm plugin can make use of either this or the Base64 format seen in kubectl output.

>Careful!
>
>When copying very long Base64 strings, a common problem is for word-wrap features to result in newline characters inserted into the copy. When pasted in this condition authentication will fail. To avoid this, turn word-wrap off before copying or otherwise ensure you have copied a single one-line string. When you then paste into the Kaholo vault or CA Certificate parameter it will get word-wrapped again, but this is normal and harmless.

## Use of Docker
This plugin relies on the `alpine/helm` image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/alpine/helm) to run the Helm command, `helm`. This has many upsides but a few downsides as well of which the user should be aware.

If running your own Kaholo agents in a custom environment, you will have to ensure docker is installed and running on the agent and has sufficient privilege to retrieve the image and start a container. If the agent is already running in a container (kubernetes or docker) then this means a docker container running within another container.

The first time the plugin is used on each agent, docker may spend a minute or two downloading the image. After that the delay of starting up another docker image each time is quite small, a second or two.

Next, because the CLI is running inside a docker container, it will not have access to the complete filesystem on the Kaholo agent. Parameter "Working Directory" is particularly important for this. Suppose on the agent you have a repository cloned at location `/home/k8repo/helmcharts`, and you wish to install charts within that directory. You must specify this in parameter Working Directory for it to be accessible within the plugin.

Helm uses a few locations to store plugins, configuration, and cache in the users home folder. On a Kaholo Agent this is `/root/`. This folder is always mounted as a docker volume so these things are persisted on the Kaholo agent from one execution to the next, even though the container running the helm commands is recreated and destroyed with each execution. 

Should these limitations negatively impact on your use case, please [let us know](https://kaholo.io/contact/).

## Plugin Installation
For download, installation, upgrade, downgrade and troubleshooting of plugins in general, see [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md).

## Plugin Settings
Plugin settings act as default parameter values. If configured in plugin settings, the action parameters may be left unconfigured. Action parameters configured anyway over-ride the plugin-level settings for that Action.
* Default Working Directory - The location on the Kaholo Agent where your helm charts are located. Normally this is a git repository that was cloned onto the Agent using the Kaholo Git Plugin in a previous action in the pipeline. If you are not working with your own charts then this parameter can be left unconfigured.
Plugin Settings is found in `Settings | Plugins | Helm`. Click on the name of the plugin, it is a link to plugin settings.

## Kaholo Account
The helm plugin makes use of Kaholo accounts. This is a group of parameters specific to the kubernetes cluster, used for access and authentication. The account can be configured in the Action or along side Plugin Settings. The idea behind accounts is that you can configure these once and then use them again and again in your pipelines without having to configure them again.

Helm uses the same type of account as Kubernetes, so if you have already configured an account for the Kubernetes plugin you can simply use that.
* Cluster CA Certificate: `LS0tLS1CRUd...very long string...FLS0tLS0K`
* API Server Endpoint: `https://34.116.131.193`
* Service Account Token: `eyJhbGciOiJ...very long string...JK3RGEpfDA`
* Namespace: `dev-test`

## Plugin Methods
The Helm plugin has three methods. Two are parameterized methods designed to make the most common Helm tasks - install and uninstalling - as simple as possible. The third is a generic "Run Helm Command" method to cover whatever else you might need to do with Helm, for example adding a repo or listing out existing installations on your cluster.

## Method Install ##
Method `Install` simply installs a helm chart. There are three parameters for this method.
* Working Directory - this should be set to a directory on the Kaholo agent that contains a helm chart (`Chart.yaml`). For example `/home/helm/myhelmchart`. The most common way for the Helm chart to be availble on the Kaholo agent is to use the Git plugin to clone a repository of Helm charts.
* Release Name - this is an arbitrary name for the "release" you are installing. Release Names allow one to install multiple instances of the same chart. If no release name is provided, Helm will generate a random one for you. For example `myhelmchart-1656768801`.
* Values overrides - use this paramter if you wish to override any values declared in the values.yaml file of the Helm chart. For example a chart might include `replicaCount: 1`, and you can increase this by configuring this parameter with `replicaCount=3`. This is the equivalent of the `--set` option used when running helm at a command line.

## Method Uninstall ##
Method `Uninstall` simply uninstalls a helm chart that has already been installed in the cluster. There is only one parameter to uninstall.
* Release Name - this is the name for the "release" you are uninstalling. For example `myhelmchart-1656768801`.

## Method Run Helm Command
This is a generic method that simply runs whatever helm command you provide on the command line for you. Only helm commands can be run using this method. For other commands use the Command Line Plugin instead. Examples include:
* `helm list -a`
* `helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami`
* `helm install mydrupal bitnami/drupal`
* `helm env`
* `helm version`
